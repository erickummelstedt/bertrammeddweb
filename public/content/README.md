# Example Content

This folder contains example content to show you how the site works.

## To use your own content:

1. **Replace the example files** with your own videos and images
2. **Edit `content.json`** to point to your files
3. **Keep the folder structure** the same

## File naming tips:
- Use lowercase
- No spaces (use hyphens: `my-video.mp4`)
- Common formats: `.mp4` for video, `.jpg` for images

## Thumbnail tips:
- Create a thumbnail from each video (screenshot a good frame)
- Use 16:9 aspect ratio (e.g., 1920x1080 or 1280x720)
- Save as JPG for smaller file size
