      "description": "Youngwilders tells the story of a non-profit organisation of the same name, founded to encourage young people to engage in nature restoration. By working with landowners and partner organisations, Youngwilders facilitates small-scale, youth-led nature recovery projects across the UK.\n\nThis film was shot on Maple Farm, one of Youngwilders' first project sites, on the Surrey-Sussex border. Filmed in the middle of winter, it explores how and why Youngwilders came into being, and how the work the team is doing at Maple Farm is benefiting wildlife, supporting biodiversity, and helping young people build a deeper connection to our natural world."
